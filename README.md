# ðŸŽ¯ The general context and objectives of the project
This project aims to design and implement a sentiment analysis system leveraging artificial neural networks to process Twitter data. This field enables the automatic determination of opinions from collected text. By using deep learning techniques, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) units, our system is especially well-suited for handling textual sequences.

The primary objective of our project is to design a neural network model capable of classifying sentiments into different categories: 'Very Negative', 'Negative', 'Neutral', 'Positive', and 'Very Positive'. Our web application takes a keyword as input, searches for tweets associated with that keyword, and performs sentiment analysis on each tweet to eventually assess the overall sentiment regarding the topic.
